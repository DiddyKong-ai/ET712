                <p class="info">Paris is the capital and largest city of France. With an estimated population of 2,048,472 residents in January 2025, in an area of more than 105 km2 (41 sq mi), Paris is the fourth-most populous city in the European Union, the ninth-most populous city in Europe and the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022. Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, and gastronomy. Because of its leading role in the arts and sciences and its early adaptation of extensive street lighting, it became known as the City of Light in the 19th century.</p>
